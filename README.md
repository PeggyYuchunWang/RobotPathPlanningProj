# Robot Path Planning Project
## Stanford CS238/AA228 Decision Making Under Uncertainty Final Project
### Peggy Wang and Caitlin Hogan

Modified simulation code from http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs221/assignments/car/index.html.

Changes - sensor simulation and fusion, path planning algorithm, particle filter inference, ability of jumping

Sensors Simulated - Radar, Lidar

Command: `python2 drive.py -a -i particleFilter -l lombard` 
`python2 drive.py -a -i particleFilter -l small`

Online path planning
